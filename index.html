    <p>My name is Tatum Mathieu and this is my website for GBDA 228. I chose to do a blog to incorporate all the things that I enjoy in life. For the most part this blog is about plants, clothes, and art. I chose a colour paleette that was neutral, but fun and included some of my favourtie colurs, green and blue. I've worked at a plant store for about four years now,which grew my appreciation and hobby of growing tropical plants. I have always loved fashion, I'm not fashion week model, but still have a high appretiation for all things clothes and accesories. Art has always been a passion of mine, I've been painting since I was young, nothing amazing but just a fun hobby, and I have created some pieces that make me appreciate other artists. This website is to showcase my personality as a whole, essentially a part of my brain.</p>
